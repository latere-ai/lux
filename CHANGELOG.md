# Changelog

What changed for whoever writes a manifest, runs `luxd`, or builds on the
packages, one section per release. A `v*` tag without a section here is
refused before it is pushed.

## Unreleased

- The store: `luxd serve` holds desired state, Key hashes, credential
  rows, spend counters, leases, the event journal, and the tunnel
  registry in memory by default and says so at start in one line, and
  `LUX_MANIFEST_DIR` selects the file mode, a directory of manifests read
  at start and on `SIGHUP`, one object per `.yaml` or `.json` file, with
  a Provider's credential and a Key's value read from the variables the
  manifests name and the API read-only. `LUX_DB_URL` and
  `LUX_DB_MAX_CONNS` are read and checked; the Postgres store itself
  lands in a later release, and setting the URL is refused at start
  until it does.
- The manifest contract: `manifest` and `manifest/v1` decode a
  `Provider`, `Model`, `Key`, or `Budget` from YAML or JSON with one
  schema, refuse an unknown field with its path, validate every field
  rule, fill every default, and resolve the references through a
  `Lookup`; the golden corpus under `manifest/testdata/v1/` is the
  contract's fixture. Fields of note: a Model name is any number of
  `/`-joined segments; money is at most 12 integer digits and renders
  in its shortest form; a Key's effective expiry is `status.expiresAt`.
- The repository: the `luxd` binary serving its probes on two listeners,
  typed configuration from `LUX_*` variables, the quality gate, and the
  design specs. Nothing routes a model request yet; the specs say what
  will.
- The design: Lux is an LLM gateway that serves every provider's API at
  one address; the API group is `lux.latere.ai/v1beta1`; four kinds, a
  `Provider` for an upstream with its dialect, base URL, and write-only
  credential, a `Model` for a routable name with targets, weights,
  fallback, and pricing, a `Key` for the credential a workload holds with
  its model selectors, limits, and expiry, and a `Budget` for a spend
  window several keys draw from. A provider credential never leaves the
  gateway. Identity comes from any OpenID Connect issuer and permission
  from an authorizer endpoint the operator writes, with a built-in owner
  policy. Dialect translation between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and the
  lux-native dialect goes through `latere.ai/x/pkg/llmdialect`.
