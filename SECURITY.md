# Security

Report a vulnerability to security@latere.ai. Do not open a public issue
for one. You will hear back within three business days, and a fix for a
high severity issue ships within thirty days. Credit in the release notes
on request.

Fixes go to the two most recent minor release series. There is no release
yet; the first one is `v0.1.0`.

What Lux protects, against whom, and how each threat is answered is
written down in the [threat model](specs/016-security-and-threat-model.md),
so a reviewer can check the design rather than take it on faith. The
properties the design commits to: every `/v1` request carries a token from
an issuer the operator listed and is authorized before an object is looked
up; a decision the authorizer cannot give is a refusal, never an allow; a
provider credential never leaves the gateway, a caller holds a Key and the
gateway injects the credential only toward that provider's base URL; every
request produces one usage record, and a usage record never carries
content.

Dependencies are checked for known vulnerabilities on every push. A
release will carry an SPDX bill of materials for the module graph and one
per image, cosign signatures over the images and the checksums, and an
SBOM and a build provenance attestation per image, so
`gh attestation verify` answers for the image you are about to run.
